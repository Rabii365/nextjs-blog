Node. js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building **fast and scalable server-side** and networking applications.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const filePath = "example.txt";

fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
    return;
  }

  console.log("File content:");
  console.log(data);
});
```
